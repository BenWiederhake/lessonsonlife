<h1>Lessons on Life</h1>
<p>Incomplete list of stuff everyone should know.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><ul class="list-unstyled">
{overview}
</ul></p>

<!-- This should not be part of the template, but rather part of the data itself. -->
<p>These lessons may look obvious; and in a way they are, especially in hindsight.
And yet they are difficult to follow in real life. I wrote these highly abstract “lessons on life” down
so I can easily revisit them every now and then.</p>
<p>Maybe some of your recent self-improvements can be traced back from these lessons?
Did I miss a thing or two? Either way, I'd love to hear your feedback, or any other kind of issue:<br/>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<!-- Again, this should not be part of the template, but rather part of the data itself. -->
<p>Live a good life; be kind to the people around you;
improve humanity, advance civilization; and if you somehow manage to make a lot of money from this advice, consider saying thanks by giving me 1% of the profit.</p>
