<p>These lessons may look obvious; and in a way they are, especially in hindsight.
And yet they are difficult to follow in real life. I wrote these highly abstract “lessons on life” down
so I can easily revisit them every now and then.</p>
<p>Maybe some of your recent self-improvements can be traced back from these lessons?
Did I miss a thing or two? Either way, I'd love to hear your feedback, or any other kind of issue:<br/>
