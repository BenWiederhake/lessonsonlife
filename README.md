> Incomplete list of stuff everyone should know. Tell me what's missing!

This is supposed to be a collection of advice on [how to live a good life](https://benwiederhake.github.io/lessonsonlife/).

Specifically, all advice should be:
- Universal
- Concrete
- Short
- Understandable
- Actionable

What you're currently looking at is the code-repository that builds the website.

## Install

You need python to compile it, and git to push it.

Also, you need `pyyaml`, you can install it like this: `pip install pyyaml`

This repository uses submodules. You should either clone with `--recursive`, or run `git submodule update --init` to get the `./gh-pages/` directory.

## Usage

To build: `./render_html.py`

To upload `git push -C gh-pages`

## License

The advice is also meant to be as free and unencumbered as possible.

You don't have to, but I would like to ask you for the following:
- [Live a good life](https://benwiederhake.github.io/lessonsonlife/)
- Be kind to the people around you
- Improve humanity, advance civilization
- If you somehow manage to make a lot of money from this, consider saying thanks by giving me 1% of that revenue.
